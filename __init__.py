""" Functionality for Argos

    This is the top level module and should not be imported by sub modules.
    The only way is up in that respect. It imports a few symbols itself for convenience. This
    allows users, for instance, to call argos.browse().
"""

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

# Prevent import of further modules when type checking so that we can run mypy on individual
# modules without other (unneeded) modules from being checked in.
if not TYPE_CHECKING:

    # IMPORTANT: do not do any imports here that (indirectly) import any dependencies (PyQt, etc)
    # The browse function is imported by the argos package, which in turn is imported by setup.py.
    # If you import (for instance) numpy here, the setup.py will fail if numpy is not installed.
